### First Gatsby Project
As you can see from the headline, this is my first Gatsby project. So far I've only worked with Next.js, another framework.
These generators work on the basis of React. I wanted to continue working with React, so I decided against the Hugo or Jekyll frameworks.

Getting started with Gatsby is really easy. The website offers a detailed tutorial that gives you a lot of support during setup. Gatsby has also published its tutorial for the different operating systems, which I think is very good. 

I had some setup problems, but after a while I was able to fix them. Now that everything was installed, I was ready to go. 
Based on my previous SASS experience, it was clear to me that SASS need to be impelmented. In addition, a blog should be included, which should be written in Markdown.

Since it is my first project, some steps took more time than I had actually planned. But all in all I quickly got along with
Gatsby. At the end of my project I built a CI and a unit test will be implemented soon.

Gatsby offers a large selection of different plug-ins which are partly provided by Gatsby, partly by other developers,
which is quite helpful. In addition, the work with graphQL offers good opportunities, especially with for the blog I decided to use this query language.

### Working with React
React is in popular - at least in the web/app field. I'm new to React and just learning it, so I'm dealing with the languages, JSX etc. a lot. Working with components makes sense, but I have my problems in some places. It requires patience, which is probably always the case when learning a new language. Also, tasks that are easy for me to solve with JQuery take more time in React. 

Still, I think React definitely has its advantages. The transition is made easier because the community is extremely large now, I always found helpful and good answers to my issues.

### Result
A framework like Gatsby makes sense, especially for large and complex projects. The work was - most of the time - a lot of fun for me and I could learn a lot. I'll continue to work with Gatsby. React is also a very exciting topic for me, I'll dedicate myself to in upcoming projects. I can recommend everyone to test one of these static website frameworks.
